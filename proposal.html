        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>The problem that we want to solve is a current lack of resouces for creating an accessible outdoor space. Despite 
          the fact that there are so many known benefits to getting fresh air, both for mental health and physical health, there
          doesn't exist a lot of resouces for making these outdoor spaces easier to access. While there does exist some good resouces 
          for hikers to get information about the difficulties of the trails they are embarking on, there isn't a cohesive platform for 
          delivering information about specific experiences on trails, alternatives to difficult climbs, or filtering results for 
          features that might affect people of different age groups or varying accessibility differently. Current apps like AllTrails 
          aim to fix this issue, but there is a lack of good filtering and connectivity features that could be utilized by those who are 
          looking to get more experience in the outdoors. There is also room for improvement in terms of connecting users together through 
          forum style features that might allow users to share experiences. This problem is incredibly important to solve because of 
          the way that many are excluded from an experience that has significant benefits to health and wellbeing.</p>

        <h2>The Proposed App Solution</h2>
        <p>Our way of fixing that problem is to make an interactive website that allows users to communicate with each other and 
          gives access to filtering features so that different hikes are shown for different specifications. This app will create a 
          cohesive environment for sharing a love of the outdoors and recreational spaces outside. Creating a space that allows users to connect 
          with different hikes is very important to what we are attempting to tackle with our current problem, and we are seeking to do this with 
          a website that behaves similarly to other hiking forums, but with increasing detail in terms of filtering the information. </p>

        <p> Our website will behave somewhat like a search engine, where users are able to filter hikes simply based off of features that they are 
            interested in seeing, which will also allow for those who are looking for a hiking experience to have a simpler time. Each hike will also 
            contain a review section for different users to leave information about the hikes for other users who might run into problems or 
            hidden easter eggs while out on the trails. This will solve the problem of not connecting users described in our problem, and will facilitate 
            the mission to create a more inclusive outdoor space. Some features that it will have include:  </p> 
          <ul>
            <li>Trail recommendations tailored to different skill levels and accessibility requirements</li>
            <li>Community forums and events to connect hikers from diverse backgrounds. This will allow for hikers who come from similar 
                places to connect, as well as for hikers from different walks of life communicate and find common ground. 
            </li>
            <li>Accessibility information for trails, varying from wheelchair accessibility to pet friendliness as well as whether 
                or not the trails will be familiy friendly for those who are trying to get their families outdoors. 
            </li>
          </ul>
