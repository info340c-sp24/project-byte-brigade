Our project has been updated to include a list of hikes as well as information based on those hikes. Our form elements are designed to allow the users to provide feedback for the hikes as well as a quiz that provides them with the best hike that would be able to suit their needs. We will also be having users create profiles which will give us information about the specifics for each user of the platform.
